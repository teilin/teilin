Hi, my name is Teis and I am a software engineer located in Bergen, the west coast of Norway. I am working as a senior consultant in [Miles Bergen](https://miles.no) and love to write code. My preferences is backend development, but I have no problem doing some frontend as well.

In my spare time, I co-own a music [festival](https://beitostolenlive.no) in a small mountain village in Norway called Beitost√∏len.
